# Documentation

- [Coding CLI release plugins](user/coding-cli-plugins.md)
- [1.1 SDLC audit and graded concept assessment](roadmap/1.1-sdlc-audit.md)

## User documentation

- [Rebuildable instructional videos](user/instructional-videos.md)
- [Watch the introductory courses](courses/README.md)
- [Native gRPC oracle declarations and qualification boundary](user/native-grpc-oracles.md)
- [Independent child repository lifecycle commands](user/repository-lifecycle.md)

Start with [Getting started](user/getting-started.md) for the shortest runnable path,
then use the [Literate AI user guide](user/README.md) as the task map.

For a presentation-length introduction, use the editable
[Literate AI overview deck](presentations/literate-ai-overview.pptx). It explains the
thesis, lifecycle, evidence model, source-promotion path, cost controls, and enterprise
agent-system boundary for a technically sophisticated new audience.

For the current manager and engineering narrative, use the reproducible
[manager and engineering overview package](presentations/literate-ai-manager-overview/README.md).
Maintained presentations and documents are modeled inside the Component system; read
[documentation artifacts as Components](architecture/documentation-artifacts.md) for the
document-pair capability, its ecosystem Flavors, and the terminal-Component rule.

For the complete test story, read [the three test boundaries](user/framework-flow.md#three-test-artifacts-three-jobs),
[clean major rebuilds](user/models-and-generation.md#clean-major-rebuilds), and
[project test receipts](user/configuration-and-cli.md#project-test-receipts) together.

For the literate-documentation contract, start with
[the reviewed project graph](user/project-layout.md#documentation-is-a-reviewed-project-graph)
and [documentation authority review](user/configuration-and-cli.md#documentation-authority-review).

For dependency and environment reconstruction, read the
[CycloneDX SBOM and dependency graph](architecture/sbom-and-dependency-graph.md) together
with [cache/publication boundaries](user/caches-packages-publication.md) and
[retained Cargo package provisioning](user/retained-cargo.md).

For the current per-Component implementation boundary, read
[Per-Component execution plans](architecture/component-execution-plans.md). It separates
the implemented Standard-bound CLI, source scheduler, cache publication, and
admission/receipt core from deferred link/package and root-integration coverage plus the
remaining sample and qualification migration. Current
writers use the [`schemas/v2`](../schemas/v2/) catalog; [`schemas/v1`](../schemas/v1/) is
the frozen compatibility catalog.

For work that must survive an agent session, start with the
[active work queue](roadmap/active-work.md) and its
[user-directed work loop](architecture/user-directed-work-loop.md). This is the durable
bridge from user direction to implementation, evidence, changelog, and reusable project
learning.

For repository governance, release-line lockdown, patch authority, pull-request
classification, and safe branch collection, read the
[Release Policy](architecture/project-releases.md#release-policy). The
[configuration reference](user/configuration-and-cli.md#repository-policy-configuration)
lists the per-project fields and their defaults.
